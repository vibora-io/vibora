### Template Syntax

VTE syntax is basically split between two things: Tags and Expressions.::

    <html>
        <head>
            <title> {{ title }} </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <ul>
                {% for user in users %}
                    <li> {{ user.name}} </li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        </body>
    </html>

1) Expressions are delimited by "{ { variable_name } }" and they are used to print data.

2) Tags are delimited by "{ % tag_name % }" and they are used to express intents like loops, conditionals, etc.

> There are many default tags and you can create your own too
by adding an extension, you can also customize the markers so instead of
"{%" you could use "#[" or whatever do you think it's best.
